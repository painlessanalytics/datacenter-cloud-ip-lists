# Datacenter and Cloud IP Lists Changelog
This is the Datacenter and Cloud IP Lists change log/changelog.

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

**Keep a Changelog**
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)

Each version section should start with a H2 (`## `), the version number in hard brackets, a space-dash-space (` - `), 
and the release date in ISO date format (ISO 8601), *YYYY-MM-DD*.
The proceeding line may contain 1 or more sentences describing the purpose of the release.
A blank line is added to separate the heading/paragraph from the list of changes.
Changes are listed, each item prefixed with a minus (-) character. Tabs may be used to indent the list.
A blank line is added to separate the list from the next heading/paragraph. The ordering of the versions 
is from the most recent release at the top to the oldest at the bottom of this file. A special "Unreleased"
section may be added at the top for upcoming changes that have not yet been released.

**Semantic Versioning**
This project adheres _somewhat_ to [Semantic Versioning](VERSIONING.md).

The first version of a MAJOR or MINOR release will exclude the second dot followed by zero (`.0`).
For example `2.0` will be used rather than `2.0.0`. Otherwise Semantic Versioning is strictly followed.
We don't waste zeros!
